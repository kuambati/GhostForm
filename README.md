ðŸ‘» GhostForm

GhostForm is a decentralized privacy-first dApp that allows users to create temporary burner walletsâ€”aka *ghost wallets*â€”to post anonymous, one-time messages. After use or expiry, these wallets self-destruct, leaving no trace. Built for those who value privacy and anonymity on the blockchain.


Why GhostForm?

On-chain privacy is hard. Most wallets leave behind trails of activity.  
GhostForm introduces a self-destructing identity layer for ephemeral interactions like:
- Anonymous tips or confessions
- Whistleblowing
- Temporary voting
- Privacy-preserving communication
